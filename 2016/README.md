# Advent of Code 2016

These are my solutions (and (sample) inputs) to the [Advent of Code
2016](http://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

Since last year I (mostly succesfully) tried to learn Python, I will
attempt to learn Rust in this year's edition.

Feel free to be inspired by this repository, but for the sake of the
challenge try to solve the exercises yourself first. I make no claims
that these programs work for all inputs (as I only test them for my own,
obviously) but they should be mostly correct.

I'm using Rust 1.13.0, but I don't think I make use of the newer parts
of the standard, so older versions may work.

The program in the repository can be run using the makefile, just run
`make test` and all the solutions will be run on their input files.
