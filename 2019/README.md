# Advent of Code 2019

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertptrs/adventofcode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertptrs/adventofcode)

This project contains my implementations for Advent of Code 2019. The
goal is to create reasonably fast C++ implementations in readable and
ergonomic C++. At the end of the contest, I will probably do a write-
up of some sorts.
