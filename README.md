# Advent of Code solution repository

In this repository are the programs used to solve the [Avent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges. Each day has its very own folder
containing a program and optionally an input file.

I am using the Advent of Code to teach myself python. I personally notice an
improvement over time, and thus over the programs I create. Some programs I
have revisited for a more efficient implementation and gave them a small README
detailing my algorithm.

All this code is under MIT license. Use it for whatever you want, but please do
credit me.
