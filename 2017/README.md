# Advent of Code 2017

Previously, I have been moderately successful in learning Rust and
Python from doing these challegnes. For this year, I'm upping the ante
and using 25 different programming languages.

The current plan, in no particular order:

- [ ] AWK (note, not included in shell script)
- [x] Bash/shell script - [Day 02](./day-02/solution.cpp)
- [ ] C
- [x] C++ - [Day 01](./day-01/solution.cpp)
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Coffeescript
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Objective C
- [ ] Perl
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Prolog
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Scheme
- [ ] SQL

â€¦ and then I will need 5 more. But that will come in time.
