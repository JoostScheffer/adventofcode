# Advent of Code 2017

Previously, I have been moderately successful in learning Rust and
Python from doing these challegnes. For this year, I'm upping the ante
and using 25 different programming languages.

The current plan, in no particular order:

- [x] AWK - [Day 04](./day-04/solution.awk)
- [x] Bash/shell script - [Day 02](./day-02/solution.sh)
- [ ] C
- [x] C++ - [Day 01](./day-01/solution.cpp)
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Clojure - [Day 03](./day-03/solution.clj) (need to finish part 2)
- [ ] Coffeescript
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Objective C
- [ ] Perl
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Prolog
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Scheme
- [ ] SQL

â€¦ and then I will need some more. But that will come in time.
