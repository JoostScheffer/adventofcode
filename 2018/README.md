# Advent of Code 2018

Once again, I will be attempting to complete the challenges in Rust.
However, this this I will be focussing on having idiomatic code and
having everything in a single executable.

To run day 1: `cargo run -- 1`. Other options can be seen with the
`--help` flag. The program will by default read its input from stdin.

## Simulations

This year's edition is very simulation-heavy. Thus, code written for
those days tends to be very long. To illustrate this, I have created the
graph below. Can you guess which days had a large simulation?

The code to produce this graph is included in the `other` directory, and
should be compatible with most peoples repo set-ups, so you can share
your pain. If it is not, please let me know.
