# Advent of Code 2018

Once again, I will be attempting to complete the challenges in Rust.
However, this this I will be focussing on having idiomatic code and
having everything in a single executable.

To run day 1: `cargo run -- 1`. Other options can be seen with the
`--help` flag. The program will by default read its input from stdin.
